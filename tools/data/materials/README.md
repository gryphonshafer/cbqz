# Temporary Materials Creation

These are programs (intended to be temporary) for the creation of materials for
the CBQZ system and stand-alone documents.

## Process

The process to create materials is as follows:

1. `fetch.pl -b '1 Corinthians' -b '2 Corinthians'`
2. `extract.pl -f '*' -o corinthians.csv`
